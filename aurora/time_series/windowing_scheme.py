"""
The windowing scheme defines the chunking and chopping of the time series for
the Short Time Fourier Transform.  Often referred to as a "sliding window" or
a "striding window".  Iin its most basic form it is a taper with a rule to
say how far to advance at each stride (or step).

To generate an array of data-windows from a data series we only need the
two parameters window_length (L) and window_overlap (V).  The parameter
"window_advance" (L-V) can be used in lieu of overlap.  Sliding windows are
normally described terms of overlap but it is cleaner to code in terms of
advance.

Choices L and V are usually made with some knowledge of time series sample
rate, duration, and the frequency band of interest.  In aurora because this is used
to prep for STFT, L is typically a power of 2.

In general we will need one instance of this class per decimation level,
but in practice often leave the windowing scheme the same for each decimation level.

This class is a key part of the "gateway" to frequency domain, so it has been given
a sampling_rate attribute.  While sampling rate is a property of the data, and not
the windowing scheme per se, it is good for this class to be aware of the sampling
rate.

Future modifications could involve:
- binding this class with a time series.
- Making a subclass with only L, V, and then having an extension with sample_rate


When 2D arrays are generated how should we index them?
|    [[ 0  1  2]
|    [ 2  3  4]
|    [ 4  5  6]
|    [ 6  7  8]
|    [ 8  9 10]
|    [10 11 12]
|    [12 13 14]]

In this example the rows are indexing the individual windows ... and so they
should be associated with the time of each window.  We will need to set a
standard for this.  Obvious options are center_time of window and time_of_first
sample. I prefer time_of_first sample.  This can always be transformed to
center time or another standard later.  We can call this the "window time
axis".  The columns are indexing "steps of delta-t".  The actual times are
different for every row, so it would be best to use something like
[0, dt, 2*dt] for that axis to keep it general.  We can call this the
"within-window sample time axis"


TODO: Regarding the optional time_vector input to self.apply_sliding_window()
... this current implementation takes as input numpy array data.  We need to
also allow for an xarray to be implemented. In the simplest case we would
take an xarray in and extract its "time" axis as time vector

20210529
This class is going to be modified to only accept xarray as input data.
We can force any incoming numpy arrays to be either xr.DataArray or xr.Dataset.
Similarly, output will be only xr.DataArray or xr.Dataset
